## results of phylogenetic placement
First level folder names specify what tree was used, and second level what set of queries were used.

`pruned` in this context means the reference tree was inferred using both queries and references, but queries were pruned out before placement.

The `V4` in this context means usage of the query alignments masked to only include the V4 hypervariable region.
